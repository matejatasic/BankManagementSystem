# Overview
This is the final project for the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course. This is a Bank management system console app with some basic customer functionalities written in C++. At first it was planned to be written in C, but after considering the complexity of the application it was decided to be rewritten in C++. Admin and teller part of the application were also planned to be built, but after estimating the complexity of adding those parts, it was decided to create only the basic customer functionalities, but those parts may be added in the future. After a while, afther getting the CS50X certificate, the admin part was added. Refactoring is planned in the future.
